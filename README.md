Module 21 Design Challenge: Designing and Building a Live Website
UCI UX/UI Bootcamp 2022

Designed a responsive website for the fictional coffee company Gulp Roast Coffee. Not required to make anything past a homepage and the 404 page. Used custom code and customized bootstrap to build the website.

Future changes:
  - figure out how to customize buttons to align with Gulp Roast's style guide
  - need light versions of font awesome icons
  - fix spacing in the footer
